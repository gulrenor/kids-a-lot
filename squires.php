    <p>Within this classroom the children build upon Kindergarten readiness skills such as writing and identifying letters and their sounds. This classroom still recognizes the importance of developmental play and social relationships amongst peers and integrates these concepts as a natural part of the curriculum that is offered.</p>

            <p id="teacher-bio">My name is Jackie Burbine. I am so excited to be part of the 4-year old preschool teaching team at Kids-A-Lot! Throughout high school and college I have worked in programs with children of all ages and during that time I became particularly interested in Child Development. I graduated in 2012 from Westfield State University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Special Education. I love the field of teaching and I am most drawn to working with young children due to their openness to explore the world around them. Preschoolers present a welcome challenge as they are becoming independent in their skills and play but also require much love and support while reaching their milestones while preparing for public school. In my time away from Kids-A-Lot I spend time with my family in Maine, and hike while my boyfriend plays disc golf. I am currently attending Lesley University for my masters in Early Childhood Education.</p>
