            <p>Our Three &amp; T4 Year Old Room challenged the children and parents with a fun, messy, and interactive Science Morning filled with stations of bubbling fun! Many of these activities are ones that the children enjoy on a regular basis as they are classroom favorites for the children. Our adventurous parents enjoyed experimenting in the eyes of a child while enjoying a variety of homemade baked goods and light refreshments.</p>

            <p>The Four Year Old Room focused on the topic of nutrition with a Spring Fling featuring edible art projects and healthy nutrition for our families.</p>

            <h1>April 2015 Newsletter</h1>

            <p>Welcome Spring! April 21st thru April 25th will be vacation week for the public schools. Kids-A-Lot will be closed on Monday, April 20th for Patriots Day; we will be open for the remainder of the week. We are planning a variety of different activities throughout the week. We are also working on reorganizing the garden in the back of the Preschool Building if anyone is interested in helping. Last year our gardens became a community trading ground with help from parents that brought vegetables from their home garden to share with others as they were left for the taking!</p>

            <img id="newsletter-image" style="float:right;" src="images/whatsnew/20150401.png" alt="April 2015" />

            <p>Our Professional Development Day was held on March 30th and was a huge success for all of our staff. Our staff was able to re-organize their classrooms as well as participate in workshop presentations related to Mindfulness and Nutrition &amp; Center Issues. After the presentations, our staff were rejuvenated, energized, and are ready to finish off the year! Parent/teacher conferences will be sneaking up on us in May! Please ask your child’s teacher for dates for conference times as time gets closer. </p>

            <p>The Week of The Young Child will be held April 13th thru April 17th. Many of the classrooms will be working on special activities for each of the children within their classrooms. Please check with your child’s teachers to see about the activities planned.</p>

            <h2>Hopping good times!</h2>

            <p>The Easter Bunny was here at the Center to visit on Thursday, April 3rd at 10 am. He was a lively bunny who enjoyed wiggling his ears and playing peek-a-boo. The children were excited &amp; used their “best manners” thanking the bunny for visiting. </p>

            <p>Our summer plans are well on there way and we have fun filled weeks planned. Please look for the weekly themes and optional summer programs such as swimming, hip hop, and karate. Some of the highlights include weekly field trips and in-house performances, and summer music program/ camp sing-a-longs. Please remember that these specials have limited space and certain age limitations and other restrictions that may apply.</p>

            <p>As you may have noticed, children are spending more time outdoors as warmer days are ahead! We are starting to find ticks in the area. Remember to check children each day; it takes a tick about 72 hours before it becomes fully engorged. When a tick is engorged it can transmit Lyme disease. An easy way to remove a tick is to apply dish soap to a paper towel and rub gently counter clockwise until the tick backs out. This removes the entire tick and is painless. It takes about 30 seconds to 1 minute for most ticks to back out.</p>

            <p>February has proved to be a snowy &amp; challenging month for all. We feel very lucky to have Steve Hebert and his crew attending to our needs. They have done a wonderful job of pushing back the piles of snow that keep coming…We ask that everyone continue to be patient during these times allowing one car at a time to pass up/down the hill in order to prevent any unforeseen accidents. </p>

Lots of love will be shared throughout the day! </p>

            <p>We will be <strong>CLOSED</strong> on Monday February 16th for Presidents Day.

            <p>December is here, the time is going by so fast! At this special time of the year, we would like to extend our warm wishes for each of the families. If you are interested in coming in and sharing your family traditions with us, please feel free to speak with your child’s teacher to set up a date. We feel that this is a great opportunity and valuable learning experience for the children.</p>

            <p>Thank you to all of you who put toys into our Home for Little Wanderers donation box. This is a great cause within the community to donate towards and help to keep the spirit of the Holiday’s alive! We would also like to send out a special thank you to the parents for their donations for the Soldiers in Afghanistan. Together, the Center was able to collect 7 large boxes with many personalized notes that were very heartwarming for the soldiers to receive!</p>

            <p>Santa will be here for a visit on Tuesday, December 23rd at 10 AM. He will be visiting all of the classrooms and spreading cheer throughout the Center. If your child does not attend for the day but would like to participate in the event, please feel free to speak to your classroom teacher to come in for the event! </p>

            <p>Parent/teacher conferences are now complete. It has been a wonderful experience to have had the chance to meet with all of the families to discuss all of the fun and development that has occurred throughout the first few months of the school year! If you have not made arrangements with your child’s teacher for a conference, please do so as soon as possible. They are a state regulation, so please do not delay. </p>

            <p>The weather is quickly getting cold up here on the hill. Please remember to send your child in with all of the proper outdoor clothing (hat, boots, mittens, snow pants, warm coats). Waterproof boots and mittens are the best choice as the children love playing in the snow. In addition, weather appropriate changes of clothing are in need for each of the children’s cubbies. Please remember, even if there is no snow on the ground, the children still wear their outdoor gear as a great protective layer to the colder temperatures. </p>

            <p>We have been working collaboratively with Emerson Hospital as they have offered free speech screenings to families whom were interested in this free service. We have worked with Emerson in the past and have found their screenings to be very informative for both parents as well as teachers. Angela O Hara and Jane Zimmerman have completed their screenings and are in the process of compiling the result forms. Emerson hopes to have all the reports completed before the Holiday Closure. There are a few children that have not been screened due to absences on the scheduled visit days but the speech team will be back in January to complete the remainder of children. </p>

            <p>Looking forward to January, Emerson Hospital’s OT/PT department will be here to start a new partnership with screenings for fine motor and gross motor development. Kelly LaPuma will be completing all of the screenings on January 9th, 13th, 23rd, and 27th. If you are interested in this free screening, please feel free to complete the permission slip form and return it by Friday, December 19t. If you have any questions about this new program, please feel free to inquire with your classroom teachers or a member of administration. </p>

            <p>If you have not viewed our new website, please feel free to check it out! A special thank you to Tim Harrison for doing such a wonderful job in creating the new site. We are truly thankful for his hard work and dedication. </p>

            <p>The pothole at the bottom of the hill has been temporarily patched by a professional paving company. Due to the cold temperatures and wear and tear of the paving from the winter, we will have a more permanent solution in the spring. We thank you for your patience as we are working on it. </p>

            <p>Our office space has been progressing nicely. We hope to be back in the newly constructed building by the end of January. Look for more updates to come as the time gets closer. </p>

            <p>We will be holding re-registration sign-ups for our September 2015 school year once we return in January. Look for registration forms with schedules to be sent home soon. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. </p>

            <p>Please remember that Kids-A-Lot will close Tuesday, December 23rd at 6:00pm for our winter break. We will re-open Monday, January 5th at 7:00am. We wish each of our families a happy, healthy, and safe Holiday Season! </p>

            <p>May the joys of the Holidays be with all of you and your families!</p>

            <p>Our Ballet Program has begun and the children have been learning basic dance steps with Tricia Marshall. If you have not signed up for dance, but have a child that is interested, they are welcome to do a trial class before signing on for the weekly lessons. Please keep in mind that all dancers must be at least 3 years old and potty trained in order to participate. Keep in mind, there will be a private dance recital in May/ June that will showcase a year of accomplishments in dance!

            <p>November is Parent/Teacher conference time throughout the toddler and preschool classrooms. Conferences are extremely important because they give parents and teachers the opportunity to discuss milestones that have been accomplished and to set forth new goals for the upcoming months. Please look for classroom conference sign-up sheets to set a date and time with each of the classrooms. Our goal is to provide each parent with a well-rounded depiction of their child and joys that they offer to the Program.</p>

            <p>Please be aware that we will begin our in-house performances now that the colder weather is upon us!

            <p>In December, we will have our Home for Little Wanderers drive. We will be passing out more information about this shortly. Last year everyone was so generous! Together, we can really make a difference for children and their families by providing new toys for children in need!</p>

            <p>We would like to extend a warm welcome to all of our families old and new! We have just finished our first few weeks into the new school year and the children have all transitioned well. Although we have had a few setbacks with the office, we have tried to maintain regular business operation for all of our children and families. We have been very touched by the outpouring of support and well wishes that all of the families and staff have extended over the past few weeks due to our recent fire.</p>

            <p>As we dive deeper into the school year it will be a year of new and first experiences for your children but for many parents as well! Some key points to help support your child throughout these experiences include the following&#8230;</p>

            <ul class="formatted">

                <li>Set a routine with your child that includes a daily schedule for home and school. Children thrive in a consistent and nurturing environment.</li>

                <li>Feel free to call and check on your child throughout the day; nap time is the best time to call so that the teaching staff are able to discuss aspects of the day in detail.</li>

                <li>Always express interest in your child’s daily experiences. Be sure to read and review the monthly calendars with them. Post them on your refrigerator for quick reference.</li>

                <li>Be sure to check in your child’s classroom for daily notes written on each classroom whiteboard explaining the activities your child participated in during the day. For younger children within the Program, you will receive an individualized daily sheet with the details about their day. By keeping open communication we hope to build a strong foundation for your child and all parents with discussion topics on each aspect of their day.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>We had to our first field trip of the new school year to Berlin Orchards on September 23rd for all Preschool Rooms. All of the children returned from the trip with exciting stories to share of their first bus ride, the biggest apples they picked, and the fun hay ride that was shared together! It was a beautiful day and great success for all of the children! Our next field trip will be on October 22nd to Animal Adventures in Bolton, Ma.
