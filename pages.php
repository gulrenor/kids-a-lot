        <p>Our Preschool Program is designed to include part-time as well as full time children. Our goal is to make this a pleasant experience for our “Pages” by designing and creating curriculum developmentally appropriate to their needs. Hands on learning and free exploration with a variety of materials and activities occur daily. Building upon self help and cooperative skills is one of our main focuses.</p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">Lil has been working with children for thirty two years! She earned a degree in Early Childhood Education from Massachusetts Bay Community College and is Director II qualified. When asked what she likes best about working with young children she replied: “Young children are always willing to try something new. They are more at ease when asking questions and are quick to forgive. They have the best smiles and the most contagious laughs. They are just plain fun to be around!” Her hobbies and interests include collecting unusual teapots, vintage pins, dolls, and old chairs that she hopes to fix one day. She also spends some of her free time reading on her front porch. Lil likes to go sailing, kayaking, cross country skiing, and snowshoeing with her husband Jim. She is also learning to ride a trike (motorcycle with three wheels.) “You are never too old to learn something new!” she says.</p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">Hello, my name is Marcia Weiner. My work career began with working full-time in the corporate world in the Software and Networking field. After my daughter came along (now 13) I decided to look for work that would allow me to be home for my daughter when needed. I used my position within Nashoba Valley Technical High School to open up a passion for working with students and their families. I feel deeply rewarded each day I get to work with children. I started working for Kids-A-Lot in October 2013 as part-time teaching assistant. In the summer of 2015 I completed a course in Child Growth and Development and received my Teaching Certificate. I am now quite happy to be part of the Preschool 3’s room on a regular part-time basis. My drive and motivation amongst the corporate world as well as my personal experiences of raising my own daughter allow me to be a well-rounded educator.</p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">My name is Rebekah Parkman. I received my college degree at Atlantic Union College in Early Childhood Education with a minor in Psychology. I have been a Behavior Therapist and Consultant for many families. In addition to in-home support counseling, I also taught preschool, after school and summer programs for all ages. I am a single mom of two wonderful and talented girls, ages 11 and 16. I love working with young children beacause of the funniest words and statements they make. I like seeing the academic, emotional, and social growth that each child goes through, and knowing that I had a small part in it. I believe that each child learns through play and observing one another. I very much enjoy learning the different cultures, values, and beliefs that each family holds. In my free time I like to watch my kids play sports, play darts, and color madalas. I love photography and art, and I am a big sports fan. I look forward to working with the children, parents, and staff and I am happy to become part of the family here at Kids-A-Lot.</p>
