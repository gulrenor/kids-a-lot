        <p>Our Preschool Program is designed to include part-time as well as full time children. Our goal is to make this a pleasant experience for our “Pages” by designing and creating curriculum developmentally appropriate to their needs. Hands on learning and free exploration with a variety of materials and activities occur daily. Building upon self help and cooperative skills is one of our main focuses.</p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">Lil has been working with children for forty years! She earned a degree in Early Childhood Education from Massachusetts Bay Community College and is Director II qualified. When asked what she likes best about working with young children she replied: “Young children are always willing to try something new. They are more at ease when asking questions and are quick to forgive. They have the best smiles and the most contagious laughs. They are just plain fun to be around!” Her hobbies and interests include collecting unusual teapots, vintage pins, dolls, and old chairs that she hopes to fix one day. She also spends some of her free time reading on her front porch. Lil likes to go sailing, kayaking, cross country skiing, and snowshoeing with her husband Jim. She also learned to ride a trike (motorcycle with three wheels.) “You are never too old to learn something new!” she says.</p>
