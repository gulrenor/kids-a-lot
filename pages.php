        <p>Our Preschool Program is designed to include part-time as well as full time children. Our goal is to make this a pleasant experience for our “Pages” by designing and creating curriculum developmentally appropriate to their needs. Hands on learning and free exploration with a variety of materials and activities occur daily. Building upon self help and cooperative skills is one of our main focuses.</p>

She earned a degree in Early Childhood Education from Massachusetts Bay Community College and is Director II qualified. When asked what she likes best about working with young children she replied: “Young children are always willing to try something new. They are more at ease when asking questions and are quick to forgive. They have the best smiles and the most contagious laughs. They are just plain fun to be around!” Her hobbies and interests include collecting unusual teapots, vintage pins, dolls, and old chairs that she hopes to fix one day. She also spends some of her free time reading on her front porch. Lil likes to go sailing, kayaking, cross country skiing, and snowshoeing with her husband Jim. She is also learning to ride a trike (motorcycle with three wheels.) “You are never too old to learn something new!” she says.</p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">Hello, my name is Danielle Aucoin.  I am a DEEC Preschool Certified Teacher and I am thrilled to join the 3’s classroom at Kids-A-Lot. I have a B.A. in Theatre Arts from Plymouth State University with an emphasis in Musical Theatre.   While I am extremely passionate about theatre, I am also passionate about working with children, which has led me to Kids-A-Lot where I can blend my two passions together.  At the preschool age children naturally play make believe and create imaginative stories.  They are at the perfect age to explore the world of theatre.   I am excited to teach the children self-expression, teamwork, and following directions, among many other things!                </p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">Hello, my name is Marcia Weiner. My work career began with working full-time in the corporate world in the Software and Networking field. After my daughter came along (now 13) I decided to look for work that would allow me to be home for my daughter when needed. I used my position within Nashoba Valley Technical High School to open up a passion for working with students and their families. I feel deeply rewarded each day I get to work with children. I started working for Kids-A-Lot in October 2013 as part-time teaching assistant. In the summer of 2015 I completed a course in Child Growth and Development and received my Teaching Certificate. I am now quite happy to be part of the Preschool 3’s room on a regular part-time basis. My drive and motivation amongst the corporate world as well as my personal experiences of raising my own daughter allow me to be a well-rounded educator.</p>
