  <p id="teacher-bio">Hello, my name is Danielle Aucoin. I am a DEEC Preschool Certified Teacher and I am thrilled to join the 3’s classroom at Kids-A-Lot. I have a B.A. in Theatre Arts from Plymouth State University with an emphasis in Musical Theatre. While I am extremely
    passionate about theatre, I am also passionate about working with children, which has led me to Kids-A-Lot where I can blend my two passions together. At the preschool age children naturally play make believe and create imaginative stories. They are
    at the perfect age to explore the world of theatre. I am excited to teach the children self-expression, teamwork, and following directions, among many other things! </p>

  <p id="teacher-bio">My name is Emily Murphy. I am a recent graduate from Keene State College and hold a degree in Psychology. I started working with children as early as 11 yrs. old when I was a mother’s helper and continued to work with children through my high school
    and college years. I began my employment at Kids-A-Lot in 2010 during my college breaks and in the summer months. I was very happy to accept a full-time position at KAL in the Young Toddler room in September of 2014. I believe the saying “it takes
    a village” is truer than you think. Every day that I gain more trust with a child and their family makes me feel like I am an extension of their family. I love watching them grow and hearing them giggle. I feel lucky to be a part of their development
    and feel good about being a comforter and a nurturer when needed.</p>

  <p id="teacher-bio">Hello! My name is Paul Nichols and I am one of the Lead Teachers in the T-4’s classroom this school year! I was born and raised in Belmont, MA and recently graduated from Endicott College with a Bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education. I am Massachusetts
    Teacher licensed from 1st-6th grade and hold a special education license for Pre-K to 8 as well. I am currently working on my Master Degree in Education. I learned that I loved working with children when I was 14 yrs. old when I started coaching basketball
    and baseball teams in my hometown. One of my favorite things about working with children is seeing them apply a skill they learned about in the classroom to a new real world setting. Other than teaching children, I like to play all pick-up sports,
    go to the gym, read, travel, and spend time with family and friends. Ultimately, I love working with all different age groups, and from this experience, I hope to give your child a fun, exciting, and eager experience into the world of education.</p>
