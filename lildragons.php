    <h1>Lil' Dragons</h1>
    <img class="mascot" src="images/programs-lildragons-large.png" />

    <p>This group of children we fondly refer to as our "Lil Dragons". They are an enthusiastic group of children, who are eager to learn and explore. They spend most of their day trying to figure out how the world around them works!! "No" is now the strongest work in their vocabulary... but words are beginning to be pieced together to form short sentences.</p>
    <p>A larger spacious classroom setting gives this age group a lot of room to explore. The number of children involved in this program is 13. The child to teacher ratio is 1-to-4, or 2-to-9 when they are broken up into two groups.</p>
