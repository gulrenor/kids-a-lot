<p>Santa will be here for a visit on Thursday, December 19th at 10 AM. He will be visiting all of the classrooms and spreading cheer throughout the Center. If your child does not attend for the day but would like to participate in the event, please feel free to speak to your classroom teacher to come in for the event!</p>
<p>Parent/teacher conferences are now complete. It has been a wonderful experience to have had the chance to meet with all of the families to discuss all of the fun and development that has occurred throughout the first few months of the school year! If you have not made arrangements with your child’s teacher for a conference, please do so as soon as possible. They are a state regulation, so please do not delay.</p>
<p>The weather is slowly getting cold up here on the hill. Please remember to send your child in with all of the proper outdoor clothing (hat, boots, mittens, snow pants, warm coats). Waterproof boots and mittens are the best choice as the children love playing in the snow. In addition, weather appropriate changes of clothing are in need for each of the children’s cubbies. Please remember, even if there is no snow on the ground, the children still wears their outdoor gear as a great protective layer to the colder temperatures.</p>
<p>We have been working collaboratively with Emerson Hospital as they have offered free speech screenings to families whom were interested in this free service. We have worked with Emerson in the past and have found their screenings to be very informative for both parents as well as teachers. Permission slips are required for all children prior to the screening process. We are tentatively planning to have Emerson Hospital visit for an initial screening date on Monday, December 16th, 2013. If you have any questions related to the speech screenings; please feel free to contact us or Mary Ann Williams-Butler at Emerson Hospital at 978 287 8200.</p>
<p>Please remember that Kids-A-Lot will close Monday, December 23rd at 6:00pm for our winter break. We will re-open Thursday, January 2nd at 7:00am. We wish each of our families a happy, healthy, and safe Holiday Season!</p>
<p>May the joys of the Holidays be with all of you and your families!</p>
<p>Best,</p>
