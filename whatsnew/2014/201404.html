<p>Welcome Spring! April 21st thru April 25th will be vacation week for the public schools. Kids-A-Lot will be closed on Monday, April 21st for Patriots Day; we will be open for the remainder of the week. We are planning a variety of different activities throughout the week. We are also working on reorganizing the garden in the back of the Preschool Building if anyone is interested in helping. Last year our gardens became a community trading ground with help from parents that brought vegetables from their home garden to share with others as they were left for the taking!</p>

<p>Our Professional Development Day was held on March 31st and was a huge success for all of our staff. Our staff was able to re-organize their classrooms as well as participate in workshop presentations related to Triggers to the Most Difficult Behaviors in Young Children as well as and over view of Speech Development with Emerson Speech Pathologists . After the presentations, our staff were rejuvenated, energized, and are ready to finish off the year!</p>

<p>Parent/teacher conferences will be sneaking up on us in May! Please ask your child’s teacher for dates for conference times as time gets closer.</p>

<p>The Week of The Young Child will be held April 7th thru April 11th. Many of the classrooms will be working on special activities for each of the children within their classrooms as well as participating in a Center-Wide sponsorship for the Clover Foundation. The Clover Foundation was created by one of our Kids A Lot families and has grown and evolved into a non profit organization that supports education for 40 Ugandan Students that otherwise would not be privlaged to such educational benefits.</p>

<p>Our summer plans are well on there way and we have fun filled weeks planned. Please look for the weekly themes and optional summer programs such as swimming, hip hop, and karate. Some of the highlights include weekly field trips and in-house performances, and summer music program/ camp sing-a-longs. Please remember that these specials have limited space and certain age limitations and other restrictions that may apply.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, children are spending more time outdoors as warmer days are ahead! We are starting to find ticks in the area. Remember to check children each day; it takes a tick about 72 hours before it becomes fully engorged. When a tick is engorged it can transmit Lyme disease. An easy way to remove a tick is to apply dish soap to a paper towel and rub gently counter clockwise until the tick backs out. This removes the entire tick and is painless. It takes about 30 seconds to 1 minute for most ticks to back out.</p>

<p>Wishing you all a Happy Spring Season,</p>
