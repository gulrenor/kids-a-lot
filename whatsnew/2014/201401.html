<p>A warm welcome back from our holiday break! We hope you all enjoyed spending time with family and friends. We would like to inform you of a few recent happenings as well as what’s to come for this month.</p>
<p>Santa came to visit us Thursday, December 19th. Most of the children enjoyed sitting on his lap and telling him all about their wish lists. Our holiday parties also went smoothly. Celebrating the season in this fashion was a nice way to round off 2013. We celebrated Hanukkah activities in November, which was unusually early this year.</p>
<p>Re-registration forms for the 2014/2015 school year were distributed this past week. If you have not received this form, please check reception desk in the office, or see Maryann, Jennifer or Pam.</p>
<p>January always brings more snow! Please remember to send your children to school with the proper outdoor clothing. Also, be sure to stock your child’s cubby with extra socks, pants, and shirts in the event that your child gets wet. We play outside twice daily, (weather permitting) so each child should have two sets of hats and mittens. Thank You.</p>
<p>The children will be enjoying learning about Martin Luther King on MLK Day January 20th. We will discuss how we are alike and different and we will discuss about what our dreams are.</p>
<p>February is right around the corner! If you are making Feb vacation plans, please let your child’s teacher know what your child’s attendance will be that week.</p>
<p>Warmly,</p>
