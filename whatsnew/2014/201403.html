<h1>March &amp; April 2014 Newsletter</h1>

<p>Dear Parents, Children &amp; Friends,</p>
<p>Happy Belated St. Patrick’s Day! March is finally here…and spring is officially around the corner or at least we hope it is! We have a lot of news to catch you up on this month, including past and upcoming events. As part of our St. Patrick’s Day activities many classrooms had some mysterious little creatures lurking in the shadows.</p>
<h2>Looking Back:</h2>

<p>February was a busy month full of activities &amp; Valentines Day parties. Everyone enjoyed receiving messages of friendship and love. Thank you to all of our families who contributed food &amp; treats for this special occasion.</p>
<p>Our Professional Day was on Monday March 25th. Our staff received training sessions by educational professionals. This year, our workshops focused on Observations &amp; Assessments for Writing Conferences and Speech &amp; Language Training.</p>
<h2>Coming Up:</h2>
