        <p>This classroom, while small in size, affords children between the ages of 3 Â½ to 4 years old to gain more confidence and self esteem in a small group setting. This smaller sized group setting is well matched for children that enter into the Program as their first introduction to preschool. It is also a great benefit for children that are best matched with a smaller group ratio.</p>
