        <p>This classroom, while small in size, affords children between the ages of 3 ½ to 4 years old to gain more confidence and self esteem in a small group setting. This smaller sized group setting is well matched for children that enter into the Program as their first introduction to preschool. It is also a great benefit for children that are best matched with a smaller group ratio.</p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">Hello! My name is Paul Nichols and I am one of the Lead Teachers in the T-4’s classroom this school year! I was born and raised in Belmont, MA and recently graduated from Endicott College with a Bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education. I am Massachusetts Teacher licensed from 1st-6th grade and hold a special education license for Pre-K to 8 as well. I am currently working on my Master Degree in Education. I learned that I loved working with children when I was 14 yrs. old when I started coaching basketball and baseball teams in my hometown. One of my favorite things about working with children is seeing them apply a skill they learned about in the classroom to a new real world setting. Other than teaching children, I like to play all pick-up sports, go to the gym, read, travel, and spend time with family and friends. Ultimately, I love working with all different age groups, and from this experience, I hope to give your child a fun, exciting, and eager experience into the world of education.</p>
