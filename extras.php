Miss Tricia is the owner of Miss Tricia's Dance Studio in Stow. She attended Salem State College where she minored in Dance. Tricia was a New England Patriots Cheerleader from 1996-2000.

      <br />
      For Dance class, each child will need ballet and tap shoes as well as a leotard &amp; tights, or comfortable pants or shorts for those boys who may want to participate (dancing is not just for girls!). In late May, or early June the students participate in a Dance recital for their families at the Hale School auditorium in Stow. The cost of costumes is the parent's responsibility. Classes are offered to 3 year olds and up and must be potty trained.</p>
