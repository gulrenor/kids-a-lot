  <p>At Kids-A-Lot we take our fun seriously. With multiple outdoor playgrounds, each designed for different ages and motor skill levels as well as active indoor activities, our students are exposed to a broad variety of games and playtime fun. From circle time -- singing and reading activities -- to creative movement to craft projects that are both fun and educational, your children will enjoy a wide variety of activities that will stimulate both their bodies and minds. Play time consists of both structured and unstructured activities to enhance social interaction as well as creativity.</p>

      <p class="desc">Each Monday morning we offer ballet &amp; tap classes instructed by Miss Tricia Marshall. Classes are held in our gross motor room. Miss Tricia is the owner of Miss Tricia's Dance Studio in Stow. She attended Salem State College where she minored in Dance. Tricia was a New England Patriots Cheerleader from 1996-2000. From 2001-2003 she was Director of the Dance Team for the Boston Cannons MLL.

      <br />
      For Dance class, each child will need ballet and tap shoes as well as a leotard &amp; tights, or comfortable pants or shorts for those boys who may want to participate (dancing is not just for girls!). In late May, or early June the students participate in a Dance recital for their families at the Hale School auditorium in Stow. The cost of costumes is the parent's responsibility. Classes are offered to 3 year olds and up and must be potty trained.</p>
