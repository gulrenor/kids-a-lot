<h1>February Newsletter 2014</h1>
<p>February has been fun and exciting month here at Kids-A-Lot. We have been taking advantage of the opportunities to get outdoors and enjoy the snow and sun as the weather has fluctuated from frozen tundra to seasonably warm & sunny! We are often complimented by parents on our commitment to taking advantage of the benefits of outdoor play throughout the winter months. In the event that we are unable to go outdoors we provide the children with a variety of indoor movement activities such as dance and obstacle courses. We have included an article with the benefits of outdoor play for your reading enjoyment, please take the time to review he attached information.</p>
<p>For Valentine’s Day, the classrooms will be celebrating with parties and valentines cards. Please see your child’s teacher to sign up to bring a treat in for the party. Many of the classrooms have been working on fun Valentine related activities throughout each of the classrooms, look for our bulletin board within the Preschool Building to be decorated with fun photos from the celebrations. Lots of love will be shared throughout the day!</p>

<h2>Schedule Reminders</h2>
<p>We will be CLOSED on Monday February 17th for Presidents Day. We have prepared a fun week for February Vacation; as part of the celebration for this special week, we will be having a special visit, and hands on demonstration with The Rhythm Room on Wednesday, February 19th. The musicians will be sharing their natural talents for creative drumming and helping each child find their inner rhythm! This special program offering is appropriate for Older, Young Toddler aged children thru Kindergarten Enrichment.</p>
<p>Just a reminder if the Center is closed due to inclement weather or having a delayed opening/ early dismissal, there will be a message on the Center’s phone system by 6:00AM. In an attempt to provide parents with more convenience, we will also be posting the emergency snow posting information on our web site.</p>
<p>If there is a regular message then the Center will be open at the normal time 7:00am. Our goal is to find a balance between remaining open and safe traveling for all children, families &amp; staff. We make every attempt possible to stay open for working families and appreciate all of the support from our families.</p>
<h2>Plans for Next Year</h2>
<p>Please be aware that we are working on enrollment for September 2014, at this point we will be calling outside families to fill open spaces within our enrollment rosters. If you have not sent in your registration and deposit checks please do so as soon possible. As always, please feel free to ask if you have any questions or concerns for the up coming year.</p>
<p>We would also like to remind you that we will be closed on Monday March 31st for annual professional development day. This day is used for staff training in a variety of areas. In addition, we have recently posted a great variety of workshop training for parents to support families in a variety of different topics. The feedback that we have received from these workshops is that they are informative, useful, and a great support to connect with families that are working with like-issues. Please feel free to ask your classroom teachers for copies of this parent information.</p>
