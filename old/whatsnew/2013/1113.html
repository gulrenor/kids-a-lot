<p>On Tuesday, October 15th the Stow Fire Department was here to present some fire safety tips to the children. After our practice fire drill, we had a presentation related to fire safety and a tour of the fire trucks. Everyone did a superb job getting out of the building and following directions to ensure each child’s safety. Our fire department was very impressed! The firemen also talked about “meeting spots”. Does your family have a plan in case of a fire? Setting up a designated meeting spot can provide children with valuable knowledge in an emergency situation.</p>
<p>Picture day went off smoothly. If you have ordered pictures, you should have received them by now. If you have not, please check with your child’s teacher. You must sign off when you take them from Kids-A-Lot. If you are in need of additional photos, feel free to email Corey Fitzgerald directly at corey@coreyfitzgerald.com. Any other questions or concerns please see the office. Please take a few moments to complete the survey in order to help us provide feedback to Corey and better serve our families in the future.</p>
<p>Our Ballet program began Monday, October 7th. The children are having fun learning the basic dance steps from their teacher, Tricia Marshall. In the spring, a dance recital is presented each year to showcase your child’s talent and accomplishment. Costumes will be ordered as the program progresses. The cost of the costumes is typically $75.00 for two outfits. The performance is sure to be a show stopper!</p>
<p>Our Karate Program is in full swing as well as. The children began class on Wednesday October 2, 2013. There is a few spaces left for this optional Program if any of the children are interested. Please, keep in mind that this offering is appropriate for children that are in 4 and 5 years old.</p>
<p>Each class held a small Halloween party on Thursday, October 31st. The children all looked spectacular in their costumes, showing them off with a parade around the center. Thank you to all of the parents who contributed goodies each of the parties.</p>
<p>We will be open Monday, November 11th for Veterans Day. Please remember that Kids-A-Lot will be closed on November 28th and 29th for the Thanksgiving Holiday. We wish you all a safe and Happy Holiday Season!</p>
<p>Parent/Teacher conferences begin center wide throughout the month of November. Conferences are extremely important, in that they allow you to check in on your child’s progress. Please check in with your classroom teachers for their classroom dates and times. Our goal is to provide each parent with a thorough, yet individual report of their child.</p>
<p>Please be aware that our Preschool Classrooms will be participating in a field trip on Wednesday, November 13, 2013 to the Worcester Ecotarium. The field trip will be a combination of hands-on exhibits and a train ride as well as lunch at the location. All children must have a “brown bag” disposable lunch with no heat ups for the trip. The bus will depart around 9 and return to the Center around 1:30 pm.</p>
<p>In December, we will have our Home for Little Wanderers drive. We will be passing out more information about this shortly. Last year everyone was so generous! Together, we can really make a difference for children and their families by providing new toys for children in need.</p>
<p>Happy November!</p>
