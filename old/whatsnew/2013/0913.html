<h1>September Newsletter 2013</h1>
<p>We would like to extend a warm welcome to all of our families old and new! We have just finished our first few weeks into the new school year and the children have all transitioned well.</p>
<p>As we dive deeper into the school year it will be a year of new and first experiences for your children but for many parents as well! Some key points to help support your child throughout these experiences include the following...</p>
<img style="float:right; margin:10px; width:400px;" src="whatsnew/appletree.png" />
<ul class="formatted">
    <li>Set a routine with your child that includes a daily schedule for home and school. Children thrive in a consistant and nurturing environment.</li>
    <li>Feel free to call and check on your child throughout the day; nap time is the best time to call so that the teaching staff are able to discuss aspects of the day in detail.</li>
    <li>Always express interest in your child’s daily experiences. Be sure to read and review the monthly calendars with them. Post them on your refrigerator for quick reference.</li>
    <li>Be sure to check in your child’s classroom for daily notes written on each classroom whiteboard explaining the activities your child participated in during the day. For younger children within the Program, you will receive an individualized daily sheet with the details about their day. By keeping open communication we hope to build a strong foundation for your child and all parents with discussion topics on each aspect of their day.</li>

<h2>Programs, Old and New</h2>

<p>In addition, we have sent out registration forms for Karate. Classes are set for Wednesday afternoons at 3pm beginning October 2nd. Please remember this course offering is appropriate for children that are 4 and 5 years old.</p>
<h2>Kids-A-Lot Happenings</h2>
<p>Parent breakfasts are being planned for the month of October. Please see your child’s classroom teacher for details as it is a great opportunity to spend time within the classroom as well as meet other KAL families.</p>
<p>Center wide photos are set for October 2nd and 3rd. We are pleased to announce that Corey Fitzgerald Photography will be returning for another year of school photos. Please note that your child is welcome to attend for the classroom photo even if that is not their regular day of attendance. Sibling sign up sheets are located in the office for each of the photo dates. If you are planning on attending, please make your child’s teacher aware so that we can make sure we have all children in attendance for each of the group photos. All photos will take place outdoors to capture the true beauty of New England in the fall!</p>
<p>We are looking forward to our first field trip of the new school year to Berlin Orchards on September 17th for all Preschool Rooms. Information has been distributed and payment for the trip will cover bus expenses, apple picking, hayride, pumpkin picking, cookies and cider! Be sure to be here early, our bus will depart promptly at 9 am and return at 11:30. Please be aware that if this is your child’s first field trip experience we have additional staff members on hand to support each group and the bus has seat belts for all children to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>Each family old and new should have received our revised handbook and forms packet. Please make sure that you complete all forms, sign and date as well as return them as soon as possible. We use there forms for each child’s file, classroom emergency departure authorization, and we need to report the immunizations and physicals for each of the children on a yearly basis to the DPH. In addition, please complete the attached transportation form and return it as soon as possible. This is a new form that is required by our licensing agency and is required by all families to sign and return. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask.</p>
<p>Here’s to a great September and an even better school year!</p>
