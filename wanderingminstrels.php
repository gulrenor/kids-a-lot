        <p>A step up in development are the 'Wandering Minstrels" - our young toddlers who are beginning to view their environment from a new perspective...on their feet!</p>

        <p>This busy group of young children is just in the midst of their "firsts" (steps, words, and emotions). It is a fascinating group to watch since changes occur daily. An important aspect of providing quality care for this age is group size which for this program ranges from one to four students. Our young toddler teachers cooperatively work together to make this a smooth running room.</p>
        <p>We provide a bright cheerful, indoor space full of developmentally appropriate climbing apparatus, toys and interesting play areas. We combine development activities with lots of time for exploration in which this group of children can learn and grow.</p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">My name is Emily Murphy. I am a recent graduate from Keene State College and hold a degree in Psychology. I started working with children as early as 11 yrs. old when I was a mother’s helper and continued to work with children through my high school and college years. I began my employment at Kids-A-Lot in 2010 during my college breaks and in the summer months. I was very happy to accept a full-time position at KAL in the Young Toddler room in September of 2014. I believe the saying “it takes a village” is truer than you think. Every day that I gain more trust with a child and their family makes me feel like I am an extension of their family. I love watching them grow and hearing them giggle. I feel lucky to be a part of their development and feel good about being a comforter and a nurturer when needed.</p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">My name is Jackie Burbine. I am so excited to be part of the Young Toddler teaching team at Kids-A-Lot! Throughout high school and college I have worked in programs with children of all ages and during that time I became particularly interested in Toddler Development. I graduated in 2012 from Westfield State University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Special Education. I love the field of teaching and I am most drawn to working with young children due to their openness to explore the world around them. Toddlers present a welcome challenge as they are becoming independent in their skills and play but also require much love and support while reaching their milestones. In my time away from Kids-A-Lot I am attending a class called “Floor Time” and learning methods to teach young children how to share. I also enjoy coaching the Cheerleading team at Ayer-Shirley High School!</p>
