        <p>A step up in development are the 'Wandering Minstrels" - our young toddlers who are beginning to view their environment from a new perspective...on their feet!</p>

        <p>This busy group of young children is just in the midst of their "firsts" (steps, words, and emotions). It is a fascinating group to watch since changes occur daily. An important aspect of providing quality care for this age is group size which for this program ranges from one to four students. Our young toddler teachers cooperatively work together to make this a smooth running room.</p>
        <p>We provide a bright cheerful, indoor space full of developmentally appropriate climbing apparatus, toys and interesting play areas. We combine development activities with lots of time for exploration in which this group of children can learn and grow.</p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">Hello, my name is Aneta (Ania) Slone. I started working within Kids-A-Lot in the beginning of September 2016. In 2015, I obtained a Certificate in Child Growth and Development Course from North Shore Community Center. In the past, I've worked as a Gymnastics Instructor at the YMCA of the North Shore in Marblehead, MA. At Kids-A-Lot I enjoy implementing movement and overall agility through the use of our daily programming. Through my experience working with young children, I have realized how rewarding and fulfilling it feels to work in the Early Educaton field. To be able to be part of children's developmental milestones they overcome on a daily basis feels wonderful. I truly enjoy children's happy attitude, their unending curiosity and receiving random hugs and plenty of smiles throughout the day. I believe it is important to have an environment in which the children can feel motivated and learn how to face new challenges and feel proud of themselves. I found a great joy and happiness watching children of all skill levels reach their goals and overcome their obstacles. In my free time, I love spending time with my two daughters, Izabela and Maja. We like to be active and go roller-skating and taking walks in the woods. I also love reading, dancing, and travelling to new places.</p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">My name is Shanna Ames. I recently graduated from UMass Dartmouth in May of 2016 with a bachelor's degree in Psychology. My love for working with young children sparked when I was 16 as a camp counselor over summers in high school in 2009. Since then, I began to pursue my interest in understanding child development and have been expanding on my experience in working with children as well as adolescents throughout college as a therapeutic counselor. I am now thrilled to accept a full time position as a Young Toddler teacher at Kids-A-Lot. My goal is to create ways for your children to expand their growth of developmental, social, and cognitive skills in age appropriate, fun, and creative ways!</p>

                <p id="teacher-bio">Hello, my name is Marcia Weiner. My work career began with working full-time in the corporate world in the Software and Networking field. After my daughter came along (now 15) I decided to look for work that would allow me to be home for my daughter when needed. I used my position within Nashoba Valley Technical High School to open up a passion for working with students and their families. I feel deeply rewarded each day I get to work with children. I started working for Kids-A-Lot in October 2013 as part-time teaching assistant. In the summer of 2015 I completed a course in Child Growth and Development and received my Teaching Certificate. I am now quite happy to be part of the Young Toddlers room on a full-time basis. My drive and motivation amongst the corporate world as well as my personal experiences of raising my own daughter allow me to be a well-rounded educator.</p>
